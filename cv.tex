\begin{rSection}{SIDE PROJECTS}

    {\bf Delegated authenticasdation over TLS} \href{https://github.com/ma9o/helib-aes-tests}{\faicon{github}} \hfill {\em Passbase OSS, August 2020}
    \vspace{3pt}
    \\ An online identity can be scattered across many different providers, all of which might not be implementing a delegated authentication protocol such as SAML or OpenID.
    A service provider willing to authenticate users
    against such a service would have to request access to their credentials and possibly face GDPR issues.
    In this scenario the service provider can still preserve his users' privacy via a distributed usage of AES CTR mode and TLS session tickets, as long as the identity provider is securing his API with TLS 1.3 and AES bulk encryption.

        {\bf Curation market for Brave ads network} \href{https://github.com/ma9o/brave-core}{\faicon{github}} \hfill {\em Coding challenge, March 2019}
    \vspace{3pt}
    \\ Brave is a Chromium-based web browser with a client side advertising engine which doesn't record personal data.
    Such ads are sampled from a candidates pool managed by a central authority which is responsible for maintaining the  quality of the ad network high. A decentralized ranking algorithm can be put in place through a curation market, which I implemented in a smart contract (using Bancor) that can be interfaced with a browser extension.

        {\bf Anonimized Aragon voting app} \href{https://github.com/ma9o/aranon}{\faicon{github}} \hfill {\em Coding challenge, January 2019}
    \vspace{3pt}
    \\ The Aragon network allows organizations to operate through a decentralized and permissioned framework. Organizations with such a requirement might also need anonimity of transactions, which is not (as of Jan. 2019) provided out of the box by Ethereum.
    Authority with anonomity can be hereby achieved through ring signatures in the browser, which I implemented with a Python library transpiled into C++ and then compiled into WASM.
